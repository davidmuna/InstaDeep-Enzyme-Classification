# InstaDeep-Enzyme-Classification-NLP
I participated in my first #Bioinformatics #Zindi hackathon, InstaDeep Enzyme Classification Challenge. I joined a little bit late but it was a really fun experience. The objective of the challenge was to predict the class of an enzyme using only its Amino Acid Sequence which had varying lengths of approximately 400 to 1200 characters.

I performed some EDA and used the #kmers technique in #NaturalLanguageProcessing and managed to secure rank 23 out of 70 Data Scientists on the leaderboard and 364 Data Scientists enrolled. The major challenge I faced was memory limitations since I only had access to 25GB of RAM on my google colab notebook. For this reason, I worked with a sample of the training data and managed to work with 25GB of RAM. However, this had a negative effect on my f1 scores but all in all, I got to learn a lot, enjoyed the whole process and concluded there's more room for improvement.
